a.
Abstract classes are used mainly for aggregating common 
state and behavior from a range of related classes.
The abstract class becomes the base class for a class
(sub)hierarchy.
An abstract class can also implement a generic algorithm in 
the Template Method design pattern.

b. 
Java does not support multiple inheritence.
If class A must be a subclass of B, but must also inherit 
methods from an abstract class C, the solution is to make 
C an interface.
