a) HashSet<E> extends java.util.AbstractSet<E>
and java.util.AbstractSet<E> implements Set<E>

Patters: TemplateMethod (AbstractClass is AbstractSet, with many template methods inherited from AbstractCollection)

AbstractSet also shows the use of the Iterator pattern by implementing interface Iterable<T>. 


b)
Composite.
A GeneralPath implements interface java.awt.Shape,
and aggregates multiple Shape objects (method append()).

Note:
In addition, it also provides an iterator (interface PathIterator) to iterate through the shapes.
Its "grandfather" superclass java.awt.geom.Path2D provides several template methods.
